## 🤖 The Mission: AI-Native Software

We believe that **Metadata is the new Code**. 

Current LLMs struggle with generating large, complex codebases because imperative code is brittle and context-heavy. **ObjectStack AI** solves this by providing a structured, declarative protocol stack. Instead of writing thousands of lines of code, AI only needs to generate concise **JSON/YAML metadata**.

Our stack handles the rest—security, database management, API generation, and UI rendering.

## 🏛️ The Stack (The Trinity)

Our ecosystem consists of three decoupled layers working in perfect harmony:

### 1. [ObjectQL](https://github.com/objectstack-ai/objectql) (The Protocol)
> **"The Language of AI"**
> A universal, metadata-driven ORM and data definition standard.
* **For AI:** Structured constraints ensure 100% executable output (No Hallucinations).
* **For Humans:** Simple YAML syntax to define data models and validation rules.
* **Universal:** Deploys to PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Edge/Serverless.

### 2. [ObjectOS](https://github.com/objectstack-ai/objectos) (The Engine)
> **"The Brain"**
> An enterprise-grade low-code runtime kernel built on NestJS.
* **Instant Backend:** Automatically turns ObjectQL schemas into secure REST/GraphQL APIs.
* **Security Core:** Built-in RBAC, Record-Level Security (RLS), and Audit Logs.
* **Automation:** Workflow engine and trigger system for business logic.

### 3. [Object UI](https://github.com/objectstack-ai/objectui) (The View)
> **"The Face"**
> A headless, schema-driven rendering engine built with React & Tailwind CSS.
* **Tailwind Native:** 100% styled with utility classes. Beautiful and customizable.
* **JSON to UI:** Instantly renders complex Dashboards, Grids, and Forms from metadata.
* **Framework Agnostic:** Works as a library within Next.js, Vite, or Remix apps.
